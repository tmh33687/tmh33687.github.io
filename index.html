            <h3>A little background information about me:</h3>
            <p>My name is Taylor Hosemann and I am 20 years old. I am a Junior at the University of Georgia pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Sport Management. I am also currently in training to become a certified Personal Trainer. My passion is for health and fitness and living a balanced healthy lifestyle! I have not always been so passionate about this subject. As a kid, I never really played a sport or was extremely active. Going into high school I began to notice that I was out of shape compared to my friends that played sports, so I started going to the local gym with my mom at night. I would normally partake in some type of cardio machine such as the treadmill or ellyptical and also  use some of the resistence machines. I was not educated properly at all on how to exercise. However, I did start to see progress simply because I was more active then before attending the gym at all. My progress was motivating to me to become more educated on correct exercises. So I began to do some research and enjoyed my time working out with my mom. Graduation rolled around and I left for college and got caught up in other things not regarding a healthy lifestyle or the gym. I began to rapidly gain weight for about a year and a half before I decided something needed to change.</p>
			<p>In January 2017 I decided I was going to pursue a healthy lifestyle. I was unhappy with the way I looked and felt and I knew something had to be done. I started going to my school's REC center and I changed my diet to a more "clean eating approach. I started to see results quickly and once again remembered why I used to love training. This time around however I truly found a passion in weight lifting. I thoroughly enjoyed movements like squatting, deadlifting, bench press, curls, shoulder press, and I was excited to plan out my workouts! My lifestyle quickly began to revolve around this area of my life. I enjoyed the strength I was gaining and the way it made me feel! 
			<p>Fast Forward to now, I have chosen a future career path based in the health and fitness industry, I have found friends who also enjoy a fitness focused lifestyle, and I have really educated myself on the fundamentals of weight training and bodybuilding.</p>

        	<h3>Benefits from Weight Training:</h3>
        	<p>- Adding just 2 days of weight training per week can decrease your body fat percentage by 7%.</p>
			<p>- Weight training builds lean muscle as well as burns body fat, thus increasing your metabolism meaning your body burns more fat at a resting state throughout the day.</p>
			<p>- Body awareness is key for moving in a way that is efficient and safe in daily life. This is important as you get older and lose bone mass. Weightlifting will aid in the adaptation of healthier joints, bones, and muscles to fight against old age.</p>
			<p>- Targetting and training muscles helps build and improve your stabilization to keep your body upright and balancing throughout everyday tasks.</p>
			<p>- Feeling stronger physically results in feeling stronger mentally. Weight training has been proven to help fight off depression and anxiety.</p>
			
		
			
        <h3>Future Goals:</h3>
		<p> I am in the process of becoming a Certified Personal Trainer. I want to spread my passion for health and fitness and educate people everywhere about the importance of taking care of their body! I feel so empowered knowing I have control over my body, and I want women around the world to feel that way as well. I am creating my first 4 week guide with 20 workouts to help reach your goals. This will be my first step in starting my online personal training business. I hope to build a community of people all over the world that have similar goals and motivate each other and share stories through an online platform for fitness.</p>
